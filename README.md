# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
Asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

### In greater detail:

- By the addition of a short message, a post and country code, the user may see the current temperature on the place of their choosing.  

#### To run this you need to install:

```
    "cors"
    "node-fetch"
    "express"
```
##### #### It was made by [Dio Papadopoulos](https://dio-papa-portfolio-site.herokuapp.com/travellingWeatherApp) as part of the Udacity's "Front End Developer Course".
